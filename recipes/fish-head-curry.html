        <p>Fish head curry is a Singaporean dish deriving from a hybrid of Indian and Chinese ethnic cuisines. The head of a red snapper is stewed in a curry with assorted vegetables such as okra and eggplants. It is usually served with either rice or bread, or as a shared dish.</p>

        <h3 class="yellow">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the fish head thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Using a mortar and pestle, crush the ginger well.</li>
            <li>Rub the fish thoroughly with this crushed ginger, and a good sprinkling of salt.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle coriander leaves over the fish.</li>
            <li>Place on a steamer rack (above boiling water) and steam covered for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a wide carbon steel wok or an earthen pot.</li>
            <li>Add the fenugreek seeds and curry leaves. Allow to crackle.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped garlic and as soon as soft, add the chopped onion.</li>
            <li>Stir, and cook till the onions are soft and lightly golden - do not allow them to go brown.</li>
            <li>Now, add all the spice powders (chilli powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, turmeric powder, fish curry powder and pepper powder)</li>
            <li>Stir and cook, adding a sprinkling of water so that the spices do not burn.</li>
            <li>Cook till the raw smell of the spices is gone.</li>
            <li>Add two and a half cups of water. (Do not be tempted to add too much water.)</li>
            <li>Bring to boil.</li>
            <li>Add salt, tamarind solution, chopped tomato, lemongrass and sliced ginger.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped okra to a hot pand with some oil and toss very briefly, just till they have turned bright green in color.</li>
            <li>When the curry has simmered briefly, add the chopped vegetables (ladies fingers and eggplants). Also, add the red chilli.</li>
            <li>Add coconut cream and cook on low till simmered.</li>
            <li>Now gently add the steamed fish head. Coat the fish head well in the curry.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook on low heat for <strong>5-8 minutes</strong>. Do not stir the curry or the fish head might come apart, instead swirl the pot when needed. <em>If you have over steamed the fish initially this cooking time must be reduced).</em></li>
            <li>After the curry has rested a while, you may choose to remove the bruised lemongrass - so that the aroma does not become too strong. I prefer to do so.</li>
            <li>When it's time to serve, bring to boil again. If using an earthen pot, it will continue to boil. Bring to the serving table while still simmering.</li>
            <li>You can also use a tabletop wax stove to serve the curry simmering!</li>
            <li>Serve with steamed white rice. Yummy!</li>
